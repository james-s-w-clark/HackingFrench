# hacking french 

dumping the writeup of hacking a GCSE french paper:

Why are you reading this?
Want to learn about some hacks that you can use to understand French, and to see that for (relatively fluent English speakers) it's not so hard to pick up

Why do I like French?
My favorute part of learning French (which i did seriously for 3 years, about 5 years ago) is the vocabulary. many words share similar roots with english, and combining this with the power of context it makes it makes French a really fast langauge to learn

Where will I take example sentences from?
I'll be using GCSE past paper material - which schoolkids typically take 2+ years to prepare for in the UK. 

I've never been good at languages. Can I really comprehend French quickly?
Yes - I believe in you!

I'd like to print the examples out. Can I do that?
Yes! Here's the link: [2016 may aqa french gcse]


page 1 - title page. nothing too interesting here.

page 2 

How does this kind of question work?
As the paper says, it's a matching activity. I don't think the example is very good ("F" looks lonely at the bottom there, without a number with them!)
So, we have four sentences that we need to match up. There are possible letters these could pair to. Ignore F, it's used up!

Let's examine each sentence and see what we can do.

sentence 1: j'ame bien jouer aux cartes avec ma tante
the key words that pop out are "cartes", which seems a lot like cards. "tante" sounds a lot like "aunt".
that'd suggest that "jouer" means "to play", and that "avec" means with. You will become familiar with these filler words very quickly!

so, what can we match this sentence to?
A et le chanteur, c'est mon frere
to "chant" is something vocal in English, and we maybe know "frere" from the song "frere jacques" (brother jacques). 
This doesn't seem like a match - nothing to do with aunts or cards!

B en particulier les series americaines
this is obviously just "in particular, american TV series". no match

C dans un club de sports au college
taken at face value, this is probably something about a sports college. no match.

D parce que j'adore les ordinateurs
we know adore has something to do with love. beyond that, a bit of knowledge (which we cant guess so easily) is requires - let's assume no match and move on.

E car nous partons en vacances en juillet
juillet looks like july, and "en" is like "in". what "vacances" could happen in july? summer holidays, perhaps. This doens't seem to be a match - let's move on.

G qui habite chez nous
although it's somewhat strange to say, one could say that something is "habituated" somewhere, or it lives there. 
chez is a word we've probably heard in the phrase "chez moi" (at my house).
ths is the most convicing match - we could take a jump and hazard a guess at the full meaning of the pairing being "I ... play cards (with) my aunt; (who) lives with (us)" - seems right!

So, for now, let's say 1G is the pairing.

sentence 2: je fais du volley
volley... probably something to do with volleyball. That would make sense, as we have that answer, C, about a sports college!

in that case, we'd have the pairing 2C.

sentence 3: je joue de la gutarre dans un groupe
we can confirm our guess of "joue" meaning "play" (from playing cards with our aunt), and
we can also quite plainly see that this is about playing a guitar in a group.

what'd make the most sense would be A, which seemed like it'd have something to do with vocals (chanteur) in.

so, let's say the pairing is 3A.

Sentence 4 je regarde beaucoup d'emissions a la tele
we can guess that "regarde" means to look at, because a tele is involved! Also, we could justify this with the phrase "with regards to" (when concerning/lookng at ...)
we don't need to know what "d'emissions" means - but it's likely nothing to do with greenhouse gas emissions, anyhow!

looking through our remaining pairing options, the one that stands out is the one about american series. so, let's say the pairing is 4B.

do all these pairings seem to make sense? yep, I think so!

could we fit the remaining pairings in? 
nothing seemed specific to july, and we really dont know much about loving "ordinateurs".

let's take an overview of the information we didn't need, and could guess!

je /j' = I. (swap to j' when followed by a vowel, to make pronounciation smoother!)
aime = to like sth.
bien = good/well (I like *a lot*)
avec = with (easy to guess from context)

je fais = I do 
du = some/of (don't get tangled up in the grammar for now, just move on! this is an exercise in vocabulary and logic, not grammar)

d'emissions = (some) broadcasts. similarly to je/j', de->d' for pronounciation smoothness. ignore the grammar.

parce que = because
les ordinateurs = computers 
car = because (another way of saying it!)

nous partons = we leave (similar to de*part*)

qui = who


so, in conclusion, it really wasn't hard to get these marks. And we may not even have studied French at all - just needed some patience and logic, and being panic-free.



page 4 /5

What's this exercise about?
again, it's a pairing exercise. The texts are on this page, and we have to link the gist of the short texts to an idea in Englsh (on the next page)

let's see what sense we can make of these texts!


text A
Est-il juste que souvent on ne permette pas aux peres divorces de rendre visite a leurs enfants?
I think there's a few words we can pick out
juste - justified
permette - permit
peres - maybe father (like frere/brother, from earlier)
divorces = divorced
visite = visit, perhaps?
enfants = seems like infants (kids, more accurately)

so, something about "(is it fair) to allow divorced dads to visit kids"
we guess a few words to make this sentence a bit more proper!


pas = not (so we'd have "is it fair to not allow...?")
leurs = theirs/their (sounds fairly similar)

with these words, which we guessed from context/sound, we get "is it fair to not allow divorced das to see their kids?". that makes sense.


text B
le centre-ville etait sale. Avec les nouvelles poubelles il est maintenant plus agreable pour les visiteurs. continuuons nos efforts

let's see what we can pick out
the centre of the village is sale, perhaps? that doesn't make sense - but let's keep the idea of some kind of place in mind.

avec (which we know from "avec ma tante") les nouvelles poubelles...
with novel/new sth...?

il est plus agreable pour les visiteurs
(? ?) more agreeable for visteurs - this chunk seems quite easy to guess

continuons nos efforts 
this seems like "continue our efforts" (nos is like nous, which we took to mean "us/ours" from "chez nous")

unfortuantely, we can't guess what I think are the two key words for understanding this text - but we have a general idea of where something is happening, and what effect it's having.
let's not worry about not being clear - let's move on, and we'll likely be able to figure this one out later!


Text C
Conservons notre ressource la plus precieuse. ne lavez pas votre voture pendant les lognues periodes sans pluie.

lets break it down!

conservons notre ressoruce la plus precieuse
conserve (our?) most precious resource

ne lavez pas votre voiture 
lavez looks like it shares a root with lavatory, so there's the idea of bathrooms/washing 
not sure what voiture is!

... pendant les longues periodes sans pluie.
? the long periods (without) ?
remember chilli con carne (chilli with meat)? you may have seen chilli sans carne (chill without meat)

so, overall, this one is about "save X(the most precious resource) during long periods without ?"
let's come back to this one later, too.


Text D
La France est aujourd'hui un pays multiculturel. Il faut absolument respectter les differences

it's quite easy to see that this one is about France being multicultural, and having to respect differences.


Text E
Fenetres cassees, livres partout. Parents! apprenez a vos enfants a respecter leur college

The first half isn't very accessible - but the second sentence is about parents making their kids respect their college, it seems.


Text F
Les jeunes continuent a trop fumer. Pour leur sante on doit les encourager a arreter!

somebody continues to fume? Let's take "fumer" as meaning "smoke"

pour leur sante ...
for their ?       probably "for their health", as we seem to be talking about smoking

... on doit les encourager a arreter
? ? ? encourage ? ?

what could this mean? Well, we can probably only encourage a smoker to do one thing - to stop smoking!


Text G
Pensez a votre famille! ne buvez jamais avant de prende la route.

let's see...
to be pensive means to be thoughtful, so "pensez" probably means "to think", or something similar.
so, think of your familly.

ne buvez jamais avant de prendre la route
?    ?       ?   ?    ?    ?       the route? the route where? How does on get there - train, aeroplane, car..?
let's come back to this one later.



Now, let's look at what we can pair these with!

a) save water
b) stop racism
c) say no to vandalism
d) do not drink and drive
e) "which campaign has already had some impact?"

well, b) seems to be matched with D (multicultural, respect differences)

a) save water, hmmm.... maybe this pairs with C (save resource X, dont wash X)

c) say no to vandalism, hmm..... let's look through our remaining options one-by-one!
A doesnt seem relevant (divorce/parents/kids)
B doesn't seem relevant (village?/more agreeable/continue efforts)
C is used
D  is used
E may be relevant - respect college (was disprespecting it a problem?)
F doesn't seem relevant (smoking)
G may be relevant - "think of your famlily"...  but the "la route" thing doesnt feel like it fits with vandalism (I don't think GCSE French will be saying stuff like "don't go down the route of a vandal...."
let's stick with E for now, and see if we can find a better match later!

d) do not drink and drive
the most relevant option seems to be G (think of your family/...route)

e) Which campaign has already had some impact?
the word "already" in the question suggests that there's the idea of time or change in the correct text for this pairing.
The word "continuons" in B is interesting, especially when paired with "more agreeable for..." (plus agreable pour ...); if something is "more", then there is the idea of change/time.


Without knowing more vocabulary, it's hard to have more certainty about the correct pairings.
However, we didn't have any clashes when pairing, which is a good indication that we were on the right tracks.

let's go with
a) save water - C
b) stop racism - D
c) say no to vandailism - E
d) do not drink and drive - G
e) which campagin has already had some impact? B

turns out, these are all correct! Let's see which filler words might be worth noting down for later.


A
Est-il = is it (see the ? later? this pairs with that!)
que = that
souvent = often 
on = one (similar!)
aux = to (same function as a/au - but we have parents, which is plural, hence aux)
rendre = (actually "rendre visite"), to visit - seems to be a set phrase

some helpful stuff, but nothing essential!

B
centre-ville = centre-of-town (city centre/downtown)
etait = was (verbs can be complex, so let's not go into details!)
sale = dirty 
poubelles = bins (easy way to remember: a beautiful girl made of poo was the pou-belle of the ball!)
est = is 
maintenant = now

C
votre = your 
voiture = car
pendant = during
pluie = rain (we pretty much guessed it)

D
aujourd'hui = today
un pays = a country 
il faut = one must 

E 
Fenetres = windows
cassees = closed
livres = books
partout = everywhere
apprenez = 

F
continuer a ... fumer = continue to smoke
trop = too much

G
buvez = drink 
jamais = never
avant = before
prendre la route = going on the road (literally "taking the route")


Again, we did very well to get so many of the pairings right! Let's see how we fare on the next activity!



Question 3 
Again, a pairing activity! Let's try and make sense of the texts A-G!

A
La technologie ne m'interesIse pas...
easy: technology doesnt interest me

je prefere bavarder avec mes copains au lycee
I prefer to ?        with my    ?     at ?

Let's come back to this one later!

B
Quand je recois un petit mot de mon ami suisse
 ?     I receive a    ?    ?  of/from my Swiss friend
 

je lui reponds tout de suite.
I   ?   respond ?    ?   ?

Il aime bien ca car il colletionne les timbres
He really likes ? ?  ?     ?        ?       ?

This may make more sense when we apply the possible contexts of the pairing options!
Let's check out the next one.

C
J'adore mon portable
I love my ? 

Je n'apelle jamais personne mais j'envoie au moins cinquante messages par jour
 I   never ?                  ?                                messages  ?
 
 Not too clear. Next one!
 
 
 D
Pour le succes de mon enterprise, il est essental d'aller voir mes clients reguliereemnet. pas besoin d'internet!
for the sucesss of my enterprise,  it's essential to    ?        my clients regularly. no ? of the internet!

we can guess that "besoin" is "need" - he doesnt need the itnernet, because he can see his clients regularly - this is the most plausible possibility, I think.

E
je ne suis pas pour les textos
I   not  ?     for    texts (seems like texts!)

si je dois contacter un de mes clients, je prefere l'appeler sur son portable
?  I   ?     contact          clients  , I prefer         ?       ?

let's come back to this one later!

F
je passe la journee devant un ecran
I pass    the day (from journal) ? a screen (note: e can be read as "s", to help us hack the word!)

alors, pour discuter avec mes collegues, je les retrouve dans un cafe en ville
?      for   discussing(?)   with my coleagues, I  ?    ?  ?      cafe in town

Not to sure about this one - check back later.


G
pour communquer avec ma famille en Corse
for  communicating with my family in "Corse" (a place - note the capital C)

j'utilise un site Internet
I utilise (use) a website

comme ca, on peut partager des messages et des photos et discuter dans un chatroom
?     ?   one ?     ?        messages    and photos     and discuss   (in?) a chatroom

Okay, so it seems vocabulary is more important here, later in the exam. 
Let's look at what we can pair these options with!


a) using social networking
nothing jumps to mind at the moment... come back later

b) making phone calls
I feel like we're missing some vocabulary we need to get this one

c) meeting customers in person
I think we can quite confidently say that this is D!

d) sending texts 
possibly B, but we didn't really understand that one
C seems possible, but let's look at the other options
we already used D
E... probably not, as this one is something like "I not ? for texts"
F this one's about discussing stuff with colleagues in a cafe - not match
G this one is about chatrooms, and possibly social media more generally?
so, I think the best guess here is C.

e) writing letters 
So, we have A, B, E, F, and G to choose from.
I think the most interesting fact that may help us here is that B mentions the nationality, Swiss, of somebody. 
Nationality isn't too important for emailing, or calling/texting (unless someone is talking about expensive rates!)
So, even if this logic isn't too strong, I think it's the best we've got to go off.
Let's say e) matches with B.

Now we have to return to a) and b)

a)
actually, I think G makes sense here - messages, photos, chatrooms - sounds like social networking stuff!

b) making phone calls... hmmm
ACEF are the possible answers.
A is about "bavarder"-ing with "copains" at "lycee" - doesnt seem like calling.
C is about so-many messaes per day
E is about someone who doesnt like texting - so maybe they prefer calling people? seems probable.
F is about meeting people in a cafe
so, let's go with b) pairing with E!


now that we've got our matches, let's see what words we were missing - but that we didn't need to get the right answers!

A 
bavarder = chat
copains = friends
lycee = college/school

B
quand = when
un petit mot = a little word (a letter)
mon ami = my friend 
je *lui* reponds = I respond *to him*
tout de suite = straight away
ca = that
les timbres = stamps (I think we could have guessed this word, though we wouldn't have been sure. I initially thought timbre could be something to do with a voice's tinbre.)

C
portable = phone (this makes sense - it's portable!)
apelle = to call (in both french and english appeler/to call can be used for phones and for names)
ne... jamais = never
personne = anybody
mais = but 
j'envoie = I send
au moins = at least
cinquante = 50

D
d'aller = to go
voir = to see
besoin = to need (we guessed this one from context)

E
si = if
je dois = I have to 
un de mes = one of my 
l'appeler = to call them (l' = them, in this case)
sur = on
son = their

F
devant = in front of
ecran = screen (remember e->s?)
alors = so
retrouve = 

G
comme ca = this way
on peut = one can
partager = to share

Quite a lot of filler words - but some are quite useful!


Almost halfway through the paper now - and we're about to meet a really meaty text!


Question 4
A true/false series of questions about someone's blog. We should get at least 50% of the answers right, then!

let's break the text down, and see how we get on.

j'aime ma vie scolaire en france
I lke my      scholarly/schol in france 
we can guess that "vie" is life

Ici les batiments sont bien construits et bien equipes, ce qui nous aide a travailler
 ?   the   ?        ?   well constructed and well equipped,         helps us to ?
    we can guess that batiments = buildings
    
Par contre, au Mali, ou j'ai passe les dix premieres annees de ma vie
for contrary ( = on the other hand), at Mali I passed ? premier years of my life

ce n'etait pas du tout le cas et je n'ai presque rein appris
it  not  ?             the case ?   I no  ?        ?

Dans ma classe actuelle il y a des eleves de differentes natoanlites,
in my class      ?        ?   some   ?      of different nationality

donc on m'a tout de suite acceptee, sans probleme
     one me    straight away accepted, without problem
     
quelques-unes de mes copines n'aiment pas toutes les regles, mais moi,..
?        a    of my  friends    dont like   ?     the regulations(rules), but myself...

ca ne me derange pas de ne pas mettre de maquillage ou de laisser mes bijoux a la maison
it doesnt derange me(!) (to) not  ?   some ?        ?     ?       my    ?    at     ?

comme ca, mon look est plus elegant quand je sors le week-end
like that, my look is more elegant when I    ?   (on) the weekend

ca m'est egal si on nous donne plusiers heures de devoirs chaque sor car j'aime mes cours.
it to me is equal (sound same) if one gives more hours of ? ?    ?   because I like  my  courses

la plupart de mes amies semblent se faire du souci pour leur avenir.
the mostpart of my friends ?     ?   ?    ?    ?   for their ?

pas moi
not me

j'ai l'intention d'aller en fac pour continuer mes etudes de langues
I (have) the intention to go ?  ? for continuning my studies (e->s) of languages


okay, theres a few bits we could have guessed due to the context, but for now let's have a crack at the questions!

a) fatoumata feels that poor facilities affected her earlier progress
so, we got that her school has really good buildings... but what about the "premier (previous) X years"?
the "Par contre" (on the other hand) suggests that those earlier school buildings weren't so good.
let's say T, true.

b) she had to travel a long way to a school in Mali
this sounds totally unfamiliar. Let's say "?" for our answer.

c) In her French school, she had to put up with bullying at first
we don't know what her "actuele" classes are, but let's guess it means "current" (actual/current, close enough!)
so, there's a mix of nationalites, and "sans probleme" she was "toute de suite accepte" 
so, let's say F, false!

d) Fatoumata loks the same whether at school or going out
I think we should go for F, false, because "mon look est plus elegant quand je sors le weekend" 
we can guess that "sors le week-end" means "going out on the weekend"
more elegant when going out on the weekend? doesnt look the same then! F!

e) She does not mind doing lots of homework
"j'aime mes courses" - she likes her courses, and she wants to continuing studying languages.. hmmm.. I think we need to do some guessing with context

"ca m'est egal si on nous donne plusiers heures de devoirs chaque soir"
 it's the same to me (whehter/if) give more hours of (homework)
 she doesn't seem to mind doing lots of homework, if she wouldn't mind having more homework!
 note that guessing "devoirs" = "homework" may be a bit of a stretch, but it makes a lot of sense - we're talking about school life, and teachers can't really give "plusiers heures de devoirs" during the school day.
 So, let's say T, true.
 
 f) Her friends all want to go to university
 well, we had "la plupart de mes amies semblent se faire du souci pour leur avenir"
 even though we don't really know what's going on here, the word "plupart", the "mostpart" (plupart/pluspart/morepart/mostpart) is a very important word!
 if most of her friends have some plan, then whatever it is, not *all* of her friends are doing something (e.g. going to university)
 so, I think we can say F, false, for this one - but wait!: 

at this point, I'm not sure about our answer for f).
whilst most of her friends may worry about their future, this doesn't explicitly say that they want or dont want to go to university
I now think that this answer is not in the text, so the answer is ?. Perhaps you disagreed with my earlier decision, and choice "?" as your answer for f) - if this was the case, excellent work. I messed up here, and didn't keep things simple!

 
 
 There's a lot of vocabulary that we didn't use for this one - let's take a look at it!
 
ici = here
travailler = to work
dix = 10 
n'etait = wasn't
je n'ai rien = I didn't at all 
presque = almost
appris = learn

il y a = there are
des eleves = some students
donc = therefore

quelques-unes = some of
mettre / de maquillage = to put / makeup on
ou = or
laisser mes bijoux = leave my jewelry
a la maison = at home
chaque soir = each night

semblent se faire = appear to be 
souci = to worry
avenir = future
en fac = at university



Now, let's look at question 5
we have to read these texts, and then answer some questons on them.

Monique's text:

la saint-slyvestre est pour moi la meilleure journee de l'annee
the saint slyvester is for me the     ?      day    of the year (anniversary/ans/year, remember)

j'aime des fetes du noel aussi, bien sur
i like     ?        christmas too, ?   ?

mais c'est suelement le 31 decembre que toute la famille se retrouve chez nous
but it's solely (only) the 31st december which (all) the family (comes back?) to our home

ca, c'est special!
that, that's something special!


Raoul:
Il est vrai qu'on voit les membres de la famille tous ensemble 
it is true (verity/truth) that one ? familly members (all) together

et j'aime ca
and i like that

mais je prefere etre avec mes amis pour le Nouvel An.
but I prefer    ?   with my friends for the (new year) 

ce qui me plait le plus
 ?      me  ?   the most
 
 c'est que tout le monde fait la fete au centre-ville a minuit
 is that   all    ?        ?    ?      in the city centre at (midnight?)
 
 c'est vraiment extraordinaire
 it's truly extraordinary
 
 
 alright, let's see what the questions are!
 
 a) What does Monique feel about New Year?
 I don't know what saint-sylvestre day is, but...
 "j'aime... Noel..., *mais*...31 december...special!"
 The above suggests to me that she doesn't prefer christmas, and that indeed she is very enthusiastic about New Year - so let's choose the answer B
 
 b) the reason she prefers it is that the whole family gets together, which is special
 
 c) what does Raoul think about celebrating new year?
 the key bit is "je prefere... avec mes amis pour le Nouvel An" - he would rather be with friends. 
 Answer A s not true, and nor is B - so go with C
 
 d) What aspect of the New Year does he like the most?
 bear in mind "the most" relates to the "le plus" part of the text...
 so "tout le monde fait la fete"  = ? 
    au centre-ville a minuit = in the city centre at midnight
    
    What would "tout le mond" do ("fait la fete") in the city centre at midnight, on new years eve? I guess everybody is having a party!
    
    
    
Page 10    

Let's read this passage about a blog, see what sense we can make from it, and then check out the questions!

me voila a Ouarzazate apres un trajet epuisant en minibus
something about beinng n Ouarzazate after a minibus ride ("vioila, I'm here!")

On a traverse les montagnes de l'Attlas mais j'ai ete malade pendant tout le voyage
 one   traversed the mountains (of Atlas?) but  I     malady  during         voyage
 
 Je n'ai meme pas pu apprecier les beaux paysages
 I  not              appreciate          ?
 
 Juste avant de partir, j'ai perdu mon passeport sur la place du marche a Marrakech
 just  (before?) parting, I  (lost?) my passport   ?  the place  ?    ?  Marrakech
 
 et j'ai du aller au commissariat
 and I               ?           I'm not sure what a comissariat is, tohugh I feel it's an English word!)
 
 On dit que les policiers marocains sont toujours de mauvaise humeur mais ils ont ete tout a fait comprehensifs
 one ? that the police  Moroccan                              (humour) but                        comprehensive
 
 par chacne, une jeune femme l'avait trouve et le polcier me l'a rendu avec la sourire.
 by chance, a    ?     ?      ?       ?      and the police to me ?   with   ?   ?
 
 Hmmm, quite a hard paragraph. But we seem to have the gist. Let's look at the second paragraph!
 
 
 En general, je trouve les Marocains tres sympas, sauf les commercants qui veluent toujours me vendre des bijoux, des sacs en cuir, meme des tapis
 in general,            moroccans        (sympathetic?),  (except?) commerece-people  who ....   sell(vendor) jewelry, sacks ? , (rugs/tapestries?)
 
 C'est enervent de leur dire toujours <<non>> car je sais qu'ils sont souvent pauvres
 it's ennerving to      (say?)        no,   because I    ?     they             poor (poverty)
 
 mais j'ai un petit budget
 but I (have) a (small) budget
 
 Heureusement la nourriture est bon marche et vraiment saine aussi
 ?            the nutrition is  ?   ?   and truly   ?     ?
 
 
 Again, we got the gist - next paragraph!
 
 Impossible de vous raconter mes aventures dans le desert puisque la connexion a INternet est trop lente dans ce cafe
 impossible to you   ?       my adventures in teh desert   ?       the connection to the internet is (too slow?)  in this cafe
 
 et en plus le clavier ne marche pas bien
 and also the    ?        not   (work good?)
 
 Well, I think we're ready for the questons!
 
 
 What does Luc think of the following  aspects of his holiday?

a) His journey to Ouarzazate
The answer for this lies at the start of the text - I think there's a word that we could guess that could help: "trajet"/"tradgey".
Having "maladies" during the voyage doesn't sound good, and he also couldn't appreciate (scenery?)! 
Let's go with N, he had a negative journey to Ouarzazate.

b) |he polce
It seemed like the police were comprehensive, which sounds good. 
perhaps "on dit que les maocains .... mauvaise humour, mais ... comprehensive" is saying "one says that ... (bad humour??), but they're comprehensive!"
Let's go for P, he had a positive experience with the police.

c)The people he met
So, he had good experiences with the police. 
I guess his experience with commerce/vendor people wasn't too great, as he was "enervant" by having to say "no" to them every time - despite them being poor.
More generally though, "je trouve les marocains tres sympas, sauf les commercants" - people were nice/sympathetic(?), (except) these merchant guys.
Well, I think the answer for this one is P/N

d) the food
"la nourriture est bon marche et vraiment saine aussi" seems to be the key part of the text
remember from the end of the text, we guessed "ne marche pas bien" meant "dont work well"? So perhaps "est bon marche" means it was pretty good.
Not sure what "vraiment saine aussi" means, without knowing "saine", unfortuantely.
Let's go for P, in this case (and hope that "saine" is good too!)

e) Communicaton technology
The interenet seemed to be slow, and the (keys?) didn't work well, so let's go with N - negative experience



So, page 12, question 7!
We have to read the article, then write down which of four statements are true. Let's go!

Au debut du mois de septembre il y a une reunion modiale aux Etats-Unis sur le rechauffement climatique
at the start of  ? september               reunion            US (e->s)  on the             climate 

Tous les participants doivent prometrre de polluer moins pour limiter l'augmentation de la temperature de la planete
 ?    the participants ?      promise   to pollute (less?) for limiting the augmentaiton(increase) of the temperature of the planet
 
 <<il faut que tous les pays se mettend d'accord pour eviter une catastrophe>>
   ?    ?  that ?   ?   ?     ?   ?      agree to       ?(avoid?)     a catastrophy

a dit le patron des Nations Unies
 (said?) the patron of the Unted Nations
 
 
 Big paragraph incoming!
 
 Pour la grande majorite des scientifiques,
 for the vast majoriy of scientists
 
 il n'y a aucun doute: le rechauffement est cause par les activities de l'homme
 there is not (a) doubt: the (heating, of the planet) is caused (by) activities of (humans)
 
 La temperature moyenne pourrrait augmeter de 3 a 4 degres d'ici l'an 2100
 the temperature                   increase  (by) 3 to 4 degrees (by) 2100
 
 Ce rechauffement reisuqe de causer des inondations catastrophiques
     warming       risks     causing     ?         catastrophic
     
     puisque le niveau des oceans va monter
      ?           ? of         oceans  ?    (sea levels will rise, using knowledge on this matter)
      
      En France, par exemple, cettte montee des eaux pourrait oblger plusiers centaines de personnes ...
      
      in france for example, this    ?    of   ?      ?        oblige(Make) more  ?     people ...
 
 vivant sur les cotes de la region Languedoc-Roussillon a quitter leur logement
 ?      on the coats of the region   Languedoc-Roussillon to quit their lodgings
 
 c'est l'existence de mlllions de personnes dans les pays pauvres qui est en question
 it's the existence of millions of people in the  (places/countries?) poor (who) are in question
 
 comment vont-elles vivre si leur maison est submergee par les eaux?
  ?            they  ?         their house is submerged by (water)
  
  
  
  Actually, that paragraph wasn't so bad! last bit now!
  
  On demande  que tous les pays decient de reduire leurs emissions de CO2 de 30-40%
     demand                (places/countries) decide to reduce their emissions of CO2 by 30-40%
     
     
     c'est aux plus gros polleurs d'assumer leur responsabilite 
     it's  to   mostt    polluters to assume their responsibility
     
     et de montrer l'exemple aux autres en limitant, autant que possible, leurs propres emissions
     and to    (set) an example to others in limiting, (as much as?) possible, their (own) emissions
     
     
     
     Actually, that text seemed pretty easy!
     Let's read the 8 statements and pick which 4 we think are correct.
     
     A The summit on global warming has taken place in the USA
     I tihnk this is true, due to "aux Etats-Unis"                  A
     
     B The Head of the United Nations belives that international agreement is vital
     This also seems true, if the "partron" is the "Head" (seems possible - "le patron" suggests only 1 patron/head)       B
     
     C Many experts are unsure of the causes of global warming
     The text said that most scientists have no doubt, so let's say this one is false.
     
     D Average temperatures could rise by as much as 4 degrees at the end of this century
     This seems true (de 3 a 4 degres d'ici l'an 2100)              D
     
     E Rising sea levels will pose a special danger in developing countries
     "(how will they live) if their homes are submerged in water"...
     possibly, though this is true for all countries, I guess.              E?
     
     F Millions of French citizens will be at risk
     It's not millions of french people that were mentioned, but millons of "personnes dans le pays pauvres"
     
     G ALl countries have agreed to cut their emissions by about one third
     Specifically, the text said 30/40%, and specifically CO2. 
     However, the last paragraph with this information in does say "on demande" (we demand) - so this statement isn't true
     
     H The countres which cause the most pollution should lead the way 
     This seems to be true, judging by the last sentence.              H
     
     So, we have narrowed the options down to 5 that we think should be correct: A. B. D. E?. H.
     Let's double check how we feel with each of them:
     A - actually, we need grammar to be able to know whether this one is true or false ("il y aura"). 
     B - seems okay
     D - seems okay 
     E - seems okay
     H - seems okay
     
     Seen as we're not sure about what "il y aura" means (past/future tense?), we could ignore it to try and be safe.
     B,D,E,H all seem like good options that are definitely true, so in this case, we have B,D,E,H, which we're all happy with
     
     
     
     
     
     Page 13, Q8
     
     There's not a lot to read here, but that's a problem  - that means there's probably not a lot for us to guess!
     This one is more about how the language works - so it might be more explaining some basic grammar problem solving, rather than showing how French is easy to comprehend
     Anyhow, let's give it a shot. The topic of the quesiton is: applying for a job
     
     a) j'ai beaucoup d'[] dans ce metier
     If you remember/check earlier passages for usage of de/d', you know that the answer for this one will begin with a vowel. 
     So, possibilities are: etudiant, experience, utiliser 
     let's come back to this one later.
     
     b) J'ai [] travaille dans une creperie et le patron etait tres content de moi
        I        (worked)  in a    creperie, and the patron (was) ?  content (with) me
        
        "j'ai travaille" has a subject, and a verb (j'ai, e acute suggests past tense)
        we wouldn't expect a verb (words ending in er), and a noun doesn't seem to fit. 
        you may know "deja vu" - somethng that you've seen (vu) already (deja)
        using this, deja seems like it could fit for this one.
        Let's say the pairiing is b) B
        
        c) Aussi, j'aide mon oncle dans son hotel a St Malo pendant [] mes vacances
          also,  I aid my uncle in    his hotel   at St Malo (during) []  my holidays
        verbs and nouns dont seem to fit the gap. Parasseuse, whatever it means,  doesn't feel like it fits
        lets go for c) H, toutes
        
        d) Je suis [] et sociable
           I'm  [adjective] and sociable.
           F, parasseuse, seems like it may fit here. Don't know what it means, but we can't choose verbs or nouns.
           d) F
           
           e) Je suis libre le week-end seulement car je suis [] dans un lycee
              I am free(liberty) on the weekend ? because I (am) [] dans un lycee
              C, etudiant (e->s, studiant) makes sense - we say Lycee/college earlier. e) C
     
     now, let's go back to a)
     "experence" seems plausbile now, when we consider what "dans" does with the sentece. To demonstrate:
     
    I have (beaucoup) d'[noun] in this metier (matter?)
    so, with out optinos we could have had
     have of using in this matter (doesn't make sense)
      i have eperience in this matter (makes sense)
      
      so, a) D
      
      
      
      
      final question!
      
      
     question 9, page 14
     
We have to read this interview, then answer the questions. This text is about a fitness guru (Nadia Widewska)

 Alors, merci, Nadia, et bonne chance
 So, thanks, Nadia, and good luck
 
 
 That one seemed quite easy! 
 
 
 
 Final questions:
 
 a) Why does Nadia say she is lucky?
 She doesn't stick to a diet regime, but is fit and healthy 
 
 b) What wrong assumption does Marine make?
Well, Nadia was born in the north of France (in Valenciennes), making her French with Polish ancestry.
Marine, the interviewer, guessed that Nadia wasn't French.

c) Why has Nadia's father had to change jobs?
"avec le taux de chomage tres eleve..." - I guess this means with the (tax) (of ?) too high - so let's put that

d) What has caused him health problems?
Working in mines!

e) Why will he be pleased to retire? 
We're probably interested in the section with "retraite" (=retire, possibly)
He'll profit from "moins chere" (less dear) "assurrance-maladie" (life insurance), I think.

f) What made her grandmother's life especially hard?
Raised kids alone whilst working

g) Why would Nadia like to viist her Polish cousins?
nobody in the family in France has "rencontrees"'d (met up) with them 

 
 That's it! Time to count the marks!
 
 
 Got 43/45 - almost perfect, and with basically no studying of french required!
